# Pharmaceutical SupplyChain with Blockchain 

# Overview
Pharma-SupplyChain-Blockchain is a decentralized application (DApp) built to enhance the pharmaceutical supply chain by ensuring transparency, traceability, and security. It leverages blockchain technology to streamline the tracking of drugs and medicines as they move through the supply chain, from suppliers to manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and finally to customers.

The system ensures that the flow of pharmaceuticals is authenticated and that the products' journey through the supply chain is transparent and tamper-proof. By reducing scandals and improper activities, this project aims to improve the accountability and safety of drug supply chains.

Tech Stack

### Blockchain:
- **Ethereum**: A decentralized blockchain platform that serves as the underlying infrastructure for the smart contracts.
- **Solidity**: The programming language used to write smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Hardhat**: A development environment for Ethereum that helps with testing, deployment, and debugging of Solidity contracts.
- **Remix IDE**: An online integrated development environment used for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts. 

### Frontend:
- **Vite+React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is used for creating the frontend of the DApp.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript used to ensure type safety and improve developer experience.

### Web3 Interaction:
- **Wagmi**: A React hooks library that simplifies interaction with Ethereum-based blockchains.
- **RainbowKit**: A React library that integrates with Ethereum wallets, allowing users to interact with the blockchain easily.
- **ethers.js**: A JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain, used for contract interaction and wallet management.

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used for backend development, especially to handle blockchain interactions and APIs.
- **Express.js**: A minimal web framework for Node.js used to create RESTful APIs and handle HTTP requests.

### Database:
- **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**: A decentralized storage protocol used to store off-chain data like batch information, images, and documents securely.

### Testing & Deployment:
- **Mocha**: A JavaScript testing framework used to write unit tests for the smart contracts.
- **Chai**: An assertion library used with Mocha for validating contract behavior.
- **Hardhat-deploy**: A plugin for Hardhat to manage deployments and maintain the contract state.
